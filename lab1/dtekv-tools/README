Installation notes:

1) Type 'make' in the folder to compile three binaries: dtekv-run, dtekv-upload, and dtekv-download
2) These binaries require the libjtag_atlantic.so and libjtag_client.so dynamic libraries. Make sure to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to these or to the local quartus-programmer installation.
